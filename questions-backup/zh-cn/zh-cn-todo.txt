there was an unexpected error parsing the 'zh-cn.txt' file following question 100, due to my inability ot read chinese, i was not to figure out why this problem was occurring. however there are 66 more questions that could be parsed. 

if there is a chinese-speaking developer out there who would like to contribute, i would greatly appreciate that :)
